# almostScheme
programming language i wrote for fun inspired by scheme and the first lisp paper

# motivation
I originally intended this to be an interpreter for the original lisp paper's s expressions. This was to be used in tandem with the m-expression i wrote a little while ago, I didn't end up writing this in a way that would make this easy or possible. This also ended up being quite a hassle and it really took a toll on my soul so the code really was just whatever hacky garbage would work.
