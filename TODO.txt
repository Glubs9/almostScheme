thousands of bugs (check stdlib)

finish stdlib
add proper error messages
add tail call optimizations
add real error messages that arent just python wiggin out
add static scope #fuck that
	and closures
make comments better
add call/cc (maybe tbh this is fuckin me about)
add type checking and appropriate errors (type checking only works for default defined functions)
some random bug with begin and debugging
handle argument arity mismatch for macros 
add atom to char list
add exceptions
handle repl stack with up and down arrow
add support for pair datatype
add type checking functions like num? and list? and func?
add named-lambda (i think this is the weird thing from the original lisp paper)
